(June 2019—present)

Célio recently obtained his PhD degree on the use of bioinformatics to analyze
terrestrial organic matter degradation by Amazon river microbes through
metagenomics and population genomes at the Federal University of São Carlos
(UFSCar) - Brazil, and Institut del Ciencies del Mar - Barcelona, Spain (ICM).
Previously, his master's degree in the same instution was on the use of
computer technologies for _ab initio_ protein production, and his bachelor
degree is in Biotechnology and Biochemistry obtained at the Federal University
of Uberlândia (UFU) - Brazil, and at the Faculty of Science and Technology in
the University of Coimbra (FCTUC) - Portugal. His main interests range from the
interface of bioinformatics applied to metagenomics, machine learning and
protein structure. He specializes in the analysis of metagenomes and
metatranscriptomes, wet lab routines and also bioprospection of
biotechnological important proteins in environmental microbiota samples.

## Huayu Qin (postdoctoral researcher)

 (since Jul. 2020)
 
 ![Huayu Qin](/images/people/Huayu%20Qin.png)

Huayu is completing his PhD degree from Research Center for Eco-Environmental 
Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The research project has been based on 
applying epicPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to microbiota and 
sulfate-reducing prokaryotes for obtaining diversity, evolution and 
environmental interactions. During his PhD, he was sponsored as Newton scholar
to visit Imperial College London in UK for several months and participated in 
a project ‘Microbial Genes and Global Climate’ collaborated by scientists from
a number of countries. Previously he did his Master of Philosophy in 
Biochemistry and Biomolecular Sciences from Macquarie University, Australia and
investigated into a biocontrol strain Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 by gene 
knock-out and oligonucleotide microarray. He is highly experienced in wet lab 
techniques in fileds of molecular biology and microbiology. His main interests
now include using a range of bioinformatic tools and models for detection and 
analysis on global distribution of antimicrobial resistance for a joint project
EMBARK.

## Svetlana Ugarčina Perović (postdoctoral researcher)

![Svetlana Ugarčina Perović](/images/people/Svetlana Ugarčina Perović.png)

Svetlana is a microbiologist with expertise in high-throughput culture-dependent and culture-independent characterization of environmental and human microbiome. She holds a B.S. in Environmental Sciences and a Ph.D. in Environmental Microbiology from the University of Novi Sad (Serbia). Her postdoctoral work at the University of Glasgow (the UK) and University of Porto (Portugal) focused on drinking water microbiome in distribution systems and urinary microbiome in women health. She has been writing for the [Microbiome Digest](https://microbiomedigest.com/author/svetlanaup/), a daily on-line summary of scientific microbiome news. Her current interest includes computational approaches in microbial ecology to explore dynamics of antimicrobial resistome in the global microbiome.
