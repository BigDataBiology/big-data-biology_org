(June 2019—present)

Célio recently obtained his PhD degree on the use of bioinformatics to analyze
terrestrial organic matter degradation by Amazon river microbes through
metagenomics and population genomes at the Federal University of São Carlos
(UFSCar) - Brazil, and Institut del Ciencies del Mar - Barcelona, Spain (ICM).
Previously, his master's degree in the same instution was on the use of
computer technologies for _ab initio_ protein production, and his bachelor
degree is in Biotechnology and Biochemistry obtained at the Federal University
of Uberlândia (UFU) - Brazil, and at the Faculty of Science and Technology in
the University of Coimbra (FCTUC) - Portugal. His main interests range from the
interface of bioinformatics applied to metagenomics, machine learning and
protein structure. He specializes in the analysis of metagenomes and
metatranscriptomes, wet lab routines and also bioprospection of
biotechnological important proteins in environmental microbiota samples.

## Huayu Qin (incoming postdoctoral researcher)

(Hopefully from July 2020)

Huayu is completing his PhD degree from Research Center for Eco-Environmental 
Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The research project has been based on 
applying epicPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to microbiota and 
sulfate-reducing prokaryotes for obtaining diversity, evolution and 
environmental interactions. During his PhD, he was sponsored as Newton scholar
to visit Imperial College London in UK for several months and participated in 
a project ‘Microbial Genes and Global Climate’ collaborated by scientists from
a number of countries. Previously he did his Master of Philosophy in 
Biochemistry and Biomolecular Sciences from Macquarie University, Australia and
investigated into a biocontrol strain Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 by gene 
knock-out and oligonucleotide microarray. He is highly experienced in wet lab 
techniques in fileds of molecular biology and microbiology. His main interests
now include using bioinformatics and models based on machine learning algorithms
for analysis on metagenomics and metataxonomics.
