This is the lab of [Luis Pedro Coelho](https://luispedro.org) at Fudan
University in Shanghai located at the [Institute of Science and Technology for
Brain-Inspired Intelligence](http://istbi.fudan.edu.cn).

We are interested both in developing [novel computational methods](/software)
and in applying them to large scale problems. [Our](/people) focus is on the
_global microbiome_ and in exploiting publicly available data to gain
understanding into microbial ecosystems. Our major projects are the [Global
Microbial Gene Catalog (GMGC)](/project/gmgc), [small
proteins](/project/small_orfs), and [antimicrobial
resistance](/project/embark).

We have developed tools, like [NGLess](https://ngless.embl.de),
[SemiBin](https://semibin.rtfd.io/), and [Macrel](/software/macrel).
