Nilesh Gupta is a prefinal year student at the Indian Institute of Technology, 
Roorkee majoring in the field of Biotechnology.His primary interest lies in the 
computational Biology and Bioinformatics. Since his early college days he was 
passionate about learning stuff related to the life sciences.Apart from doing 
academia and research he could be seen watching animal planet, gardening and 
discussing soci-economic stuff.

#### Ariana Thakurdyal (undergraduate student)

books, or watching anime/TV shows.

#### Tristan Gallent (undergraduate student)

Tristan is recently graduated with a BSc in Mathematics from Monash University,
Australia. While also doing some computer science at University, he become
interested in bioinformatics and computational biology after learning about its
applications for medicine, the massive increase in data available to the field
and the theoretical aspects that overlap with computer science, mathematics and
biology. In his spare time he enjoys reading, music, sports and learning new
things.


### Summer 2020

This was the first group of interns and it was organized through the _National
Summer Undergraduate Research Project_, [NSURP](https://nsurp.org/),

#### Tobi Olanipekun Gabriel

In Summer 2020, Tobi Olanipekun Gabriel was a final year student at the
University of Ibadan, where he is studying for his Doctor of Veterinary
Medicine Program (DVM). His scientific interests lie in the areas of Genomic
research and Big data analysis. interest in this area was born primarily by
online courses he had completed (such as the recently completed IBT course from
H3ABionet). This inspired him to take part in various research opportunities
(such as the NSURP program in conjunction with ISBTI Fudan University) from
where he gathers relevant experiences and skills in bioinformatics. He aspires
to pursue a career in genomics and to discover useful information from the
study of genomes via a masters and or PhD in this field. His other interests
include tutoring, web design (wordpress) and graphic design.


#### Fernanda Ordoñez Jiménez (undergraduate student)

![FerOrdoñez.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/people/FerOrdoñez.png)

Fernanda is a rising senior at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)
majoring in Biomedical Physics. Her main reaserch interests are computational
biology and biomedical informatics. Besides science Fernanda enjoys hiking
trips, yoga, reading and spending time with friends and family.
