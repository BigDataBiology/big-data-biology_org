**tl;dr**: Learn how to use
[SemiBin](https://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin/) from the original
developers. In particular, we will see how to run SemiBin on a set of of human
gut samples with different binning modes.

### Prerequisites

What you should _know_/_be able to do_ **before** the tutorial:

- You should know what a contig and BAM file is.
- You should be able to run programmes on the command line
- You should be able to install the SemiBin. You can see the details from [How to install](https://semibin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/).

You will also be sent some information a few days before the tutorial with both the signup links &amp; and some requests to prepare for the event. You should expect to spend some time (10-15 minutes) installing the software and downloading the tutorial data.

### Learning objectives

- What is the metagenomic binning and what is the basic idea of existing binning tools?
- The basic idea behind SemiBin.
- How to get MAGs from SemiBin with different binning modes.
- We will not cover functional analysis of MAGs.

### Location &amp; Schedule

**Date**: 23rd October, 2023 @ 21h30 UTC (this is 5.30pm EDT/2.30pm PDT; morning of the 24th in Australia, [check your timezone](https://everytimezone.com/s/634a8987))

**Location**: Zoom &amp; Discord (links will be sent to registered participants)
