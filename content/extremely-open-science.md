title: Extremely Open Science 2024
meta: "Extremely Open Science is about doing everything truly in the open: streaming the development, discussions, chats, &c"
---

This is a simple idea: we will develop scientific projects completely online: everything will be streamed, online discussions will be on a public mailing-list/discord server, code will be on GitHub, data is publicly available.

## How to keep up

- Join the [mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/g/extremely-open-science)
- Join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/XFXQPnrFHU)
- Watch the streams or catch up videos on [our YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@BigDataBiology)


## Project for 2024

_This will start on January 29th 2024!_

We will try to answer the following scientific question: _what antimicrobial resistance genes co-occur in genomes and metagenomes and does it matter?_
