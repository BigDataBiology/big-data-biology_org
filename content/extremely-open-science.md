title: Extremely Open Science 2024
meta: "Extremely Open Science is about doing everything truly in the open: streaming the development, discussions, chats, &c"
---

This is a simple idea: we will develop scientific projects completely online: everything will be streamed, online discussions will be on a public mailing-list/discord server, code will be on GitHub, data is publicly available.


Streams take place on _Monday evening_ (US time), which is Tuesday morning for Luis (AUS time). A recap video is posted on YouTube after the stream ([recap playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-O3n63-fcY&list=PLn-ZqA9cHNdRtmU0vpsda1Bc4b_JsJ53J&ab_channel=BigDataBiology-Lab).

**Update August 2024**: Streams will be on as usual, except for the week of August 19/20 due to _ISME19_.

## Season 2

We are currently working on the following scientific question: _Can we estimate the quality of a genome from an overabundance of pseudogenes?_

See the [sardyne repository](https://github.com/BigDataBiology/sardyne) for more information.

## Season 1

We tried to answer the following scientific question: _what antimicrobial resistance genes co-occur in genomes and metagenomes and does it matter?_
