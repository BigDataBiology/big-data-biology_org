title: Extremely Open Science 2024
meta: "Extremely Open Science is about doing everything truly in the open: streaming the development, discussions, chats, &c"
---

This is a simple idea: we will develop scientific projects completely online: everything will be streamed, online discussions will be on a public mailing-list/discord server, code will be on GitHub, data is publicly available.
