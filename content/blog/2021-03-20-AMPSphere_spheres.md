A short time after the release of [AMPSphere v.2021-02](https://zenodo.org/record/4574469#.YFT-URERWV4), we now make available the validated SPHERE families obtained by clustering the alphabet-reduced antimicrobial peptide sequences.

This new version [v.2021-03](https://zenodo.org/record/4606582#.YFT-rhERWV4) brings alignments and trees in Newick format calculated from families in the level III (hierarchically clustered by 100-85-75% of identity) with 8 sequences or more.

No other major changes were made in the other files besides the naming.
