We are looking for PhD students!

A background in computer science, bioinformatics, microbiology, or genomics is best, but there is no strict limits. Some basic programming skills are needed (some projects require more than others).

Projects can be defined for and with each individual student within the broad topic of studying the global microbiome, but some particular projects in the group are

1. [small proteins of the global microbiome](/project/small_orfs/)
2. [antibiotic resistance at the global scale](/project/embark)
3. [tool development for metagenomics](/software/).

Our [lab manual](/manual) contains our work philosophy and work methods. 

Besides our group, [CMR](https://research.qut.edu.au/cmr/) houses some of the leading experts in microbiome science, including Gene Tyson who started the centre in 2020 and is one of the leaders in the field. As part of CMR, students have access to computing and laboratory facilities.

Feel free [to get in touch with questions](mailto:luispedro@big-data-biology.org)

We will have more open positions in the medium-term, so if someone will be interested but can only start later, they should still get in touch.
