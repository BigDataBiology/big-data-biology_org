Fellow researchers,

We are glad to inform you that the database **AMPSphere v.2021-02** is now available online under DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.4574469](https://zenodo.org/record/4574469#.YEI4HhERWV4).

**AMPSphere** is a comprehensive catalog of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) predicted using **Macrel** (DOI: [10.7717/peerj.10555](https://peerj.com/articles/10555/)) from 63,410 public metagenomes, [ProGenomes v2.2](progenomes.embl.de/) database (82,400 high-quality microbial genomes), and c.a. 4k non-whitelisted microbial genomes from NCBI. The version v.2021-02 contains 863,498 sequences (avg length: 36 amino acids, range 8-98), with 2,488 peptides characterized in [DRAMP](dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/).

Different approaches were used to ensure the quality of these sequences. Not only peptides but also the nucleotide sequences from the variants detected per AMP also were included in this version of **AMPSphere**. This expands the set of possible analyses performed with this dataset.

We hope that this new resource can help you in your research and kindly ask you to spread the news to anyone that may be interested in this field.
