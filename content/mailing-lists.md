We post on two email newsletters/announcements that you can sign up for

1. [BDB-Lab updates](https://bigdatabiology.substack.com/): quarterly updates
2. [Tutorial announcements](http://eepurl.com/hAZM1n): we pre-announce tutorials that we run on this list (see [past tutorials](/tutorials))

These lists are one-way (i.e., we are the only ones posting), but we are happy to [hear from you](mailto:luispedro@big-data-biology.org).

You can also [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BigDataBiology) and see our [videos on YouTube](https://youtube.com/@BigDataBiology).
