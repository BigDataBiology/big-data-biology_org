<!-- For questions, we will have [online office
hours](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEqf-qsqjIsHNJlxpdyzjPPy5s42_D2l9PQ)
on January 13 at Noon UTC (check your timezone!)
-->

**Currently, we are not accepting applications for remote internships.**

During the internship, you will be assigned a project (often with another lab
member) which will be designed to be feasible given your current set of skills
while teaching you novel ones. Projects can be either computational (either
implementation- or algorithmic-focused) or more driven by biological questions.
See the [lab interests page]({{site.baseurl}}/interests).

### We expect you to

- Contribute at least 20 hours per week during the internship period.
- Be able to participate for 6-12 weeks (depending on how much time per week
  you can commit).
- Have regular access to a decent internet connection (it should be good enough
  that you can have regular voice Zoom/Skype calls).
- Be an active lab member and strive for producing excellent, reproducible,
  science in your own project (excellence is not about doing a large project,
  rather it is about being thoughtful in ensuring that all the small details
  are looked at carefully).
- Abide by the [lab manual]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual).

### You get

- Weekly meetings with your direct advisor for discussing the project
  and mentoring.
- Regular meetings with the PI (Luis Pedro Coelho).
- Meetings with other [lab members]({{ site.baseurl }}/people) and
  participation in the group meetings/discussions.

Should your work be used in a publication later, you will be asked to be an
author on it, but (1) there is no guarantee that your work will be used in a
publication and timelines can vary (science is unpredictable), (2) will likely
involve further involvement beyond the original internship period should the
opportunity arise (but successfully completing the internship is independent of
any follow-up work).

## To apply

**Previous deadline**: _February 5 2023_ (applications are currently closed).

Anyone can apply, but this programme is primarily aimed at:

- Junior students (undergraduate +/- 2 years).
- Students in [LMICs](https://wellcome.ac.uk/grant-funding/guidance/low-and-middle-income-countries).
- With _either_ some bioinformatics/computational biology training
  (alternatively, computer science students who want to work on
  bioinformatics) **or** some interest in contributing in a non-scientific way
  (community building, science communication, mixing art &amp; science, ...)

Students with no research experience are welcome!

Send an [email](mailto:luispedro@big-data-biology.org) with the subject _Remote
internship application_, containing:

1. A short motivation letter in the body of the email, describing what stage of
   the career you are (undergraduate, in which major/degree, what year?), and a
   brief description of relevant experience or plans for the future. There are
   no strict format requirements, but, if printed out, it should not be longer
   than a page. If in doubt, shorter is better.

2. A CV (ideally in PDF format, **without** a photo). Please highlight any
   links to github, google scholar, &amp;c (while keeping in mind that having these
   is not at all a requirement!).

3. Please describe the exact period in which you could participate. We're
   flexible but, in this round, you should be able to point to 6-12 weeks
   starting in the next few months (_e.g._, "I can participate for 20
   hours/week during May-September, except for a holiday period in July"). If
   you would like to participate, but cannot commit any time before Fall 2022,
   please wait for the next round.

You should get a short acknowledgement that the email was received within 48-72
hours (likely sooner, but if you did not receive on within that time period,
please just resend the email).

Short-listed candidates may be asked for a recommendation letter and
interviewed (remotely).
