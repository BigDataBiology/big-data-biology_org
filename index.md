This is the lab of [Luis Pedro Coelho](http://luispedro.org) at Fudan
University in Shanghai located at the [Institute of Science and Technology for
Brain-Inspired Intelligence](http://istbi.fudan.edu.cn).

We are interested both in developing novel computational methods and in
applying them to large scale problems. Our focus is on the _global microbiome_
and in exploiting publicly available data to gain understanding into microbial
ecosystems.

_Lab motto_: "Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail
better. — S. Beckett, in other words, **failing is the job**.
