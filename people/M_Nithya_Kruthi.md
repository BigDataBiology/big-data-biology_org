Kruthi holds a Master of Science (MSc) in Bioinformatics from Amity University, Noida, and a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Biotechnology, Zoology, and Chemistry from Osmania University, with impressive academic achievements. Kruthi’s interest lies in the study of small proteins and their functions, as well as microbiome data analysis. For her research, she is focused on exploring the functionality of small proteins (≤100 amino acids) in microbial genomes using synteny analysis. Her work involves developing computational approaches to functionally annotate small proteins. By combining computational biology and genomic analysis, her research aims to uncover novel small proteins and their biological roles, with the potential to enhance our understanding of microbial physiology and its applications in biotechnology and microbiome research.
