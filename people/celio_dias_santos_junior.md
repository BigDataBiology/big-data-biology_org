Célio obtained his PhD degree on the use of bioinformatics to analyze
terrestrial organic matter degradation by Amazon river microbes through
metagenomics and population genomes.
His main interests range from the interface of bioinformatics applied to
metagenomics, machine learning and protein structure. He specializes in
the analysis of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes, wet lab routines and
also bioprospection of biotechnological important proteins in environmental
microbiota samples.
