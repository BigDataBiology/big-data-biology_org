# How to add a lab member

You can use the file `luis_pedro_coelho.md` as inspiration.

You should also add a short update in the main page of the website by editing `../content/index.md`.

## Mandatory fields

- `name`: Note that this should match the name you use in publications.
- `title`: Should be one of `PI`, `Postdoctoral researcher`, `Graduate student`, or `Visitor`
- `joined`: A date (e.g., "2018-09-01")
- `short_bio`: text

## Optional fields
- `github`: GH username
- `twitter`: Twitter username
- `gscholar`: The GScholar user ID
- `orcid`: ORCID

The main body of the document is a longer biography.

## Photo

Add a file in `public/images/` with **exactly the same filename** (except the
extension (which must be `.jpeg`). So, for Luis, the photo is called
`public/images/people/luis_pedro_coelho.jpeg`
