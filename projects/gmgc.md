The Global Microbial Gene Catalog (GMGC) is an effort to catalog all the genes
in the _global microbiome_. It is based on a collection of hand-curated
metagenomes, which were _consistently processed_ with the same computational
pipeline.

Version 1 of the catalog (available at
[https://gmgc.embl.de](https://gmgc.embl.de)) was derived from 13 thousand
metagenomes. This resulted in just over 2 billion ORF (individual input
sequences), which were first clustered into 303 million _unigenes_ (this is a
species-level clustering, at 95% nucleotide identity).  The unigenes were then
clustered into 32 million _protein families_ (distant homology).

Furthermore, these unigenes are functionally and taxonomically annotated and
MAGs are available from the same contigs (46,655 high-quality MAGs).

This project is conducted in collaboration with the [Bork Group at
EMBL](https://www.embl.org/groups/bork/) and the [Huerta-Cepas group at
CPGB](http://compgenomics.org/).
