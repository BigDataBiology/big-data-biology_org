Small open reading frames(smORFs) are often ignored because of the minimal cutoff of 100 codons in
traditional gene annotation. However, recent studies indicated that small proteins produced by smORFs
serve as important functional elements in cellular biology, including the regulation of amino acid
metabolism, antimicrobial activity, etc. Due to computational and experimental difficulties, it still
remains a challenge to identify and characterize small proteins. The main limitation is lack of complete
and reliable smORFs database, especially in microbiome.Therefore, we constructed the global microbial
smORFs catalog(GMSC), which can provide a complete annotated resource in global microbiome across various
environments.

We predicted 4.5 billion smORFs from GMGCv2 and ProGenomes including tens of thousands metagenomes and
high-quality microbial genomes using a modified version of Prodigal. By eliminating redundancy and clustering,
we obtained smORFs catalog on 100%,90% and 50% sequence identity level. We excluded spurious smORFs using Antifam
and checked their coding potential using RNAcode. Then we used metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics and metariboseq
to validate.Finally, to characterize them, we assigned taxonomy and habitat to them based on metadata.

In 100% idntity smORFs catalog, 30% smORFs were predicted to coding potential and around 1% smORFs were validated
by multi-omics data, which contain at least 12 million smORFs. After assigning taxonomy using LCA, nearly 80% of
smORFs can be annotated on super kingdom level and nearly 40% of smORFs can be annotated on species level.

[Yiqian Duan](https://twitter.com/cocodyq) is a bioinformatician with expertise in high-throughput
sequencing to characterize environmental microbiomes. She is a Ph.D. candidate in
BDB since 2020, and is interested in the distribution, diversity and dynamics of small ORFs. Currently,
Yiqian and Dr. Celio Dias Santos Junior are conducting the investigations on the collaborative work
involving small ORFs.

This project is conducted in collaboration with the [Bork Group at
EMBL](https://www.embl.org/groups/bork/) and the [Huerta-Cepas group at
CPGB](http://compgenomics.org/).
