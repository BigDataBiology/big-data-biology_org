Sharing of research code would greatly benefit neuroscience, but this practice
is hampered by a collective action problem. Since the development of the
internet, conditional pledge platforms (e.g., Kickstarter) have increasingly
been used to solve globally-dispersed collective action problems (Hallam,
2016). However, this strategy has yet to be implemented within academia. In
this brief paper, we introduce a general purpose conditional pledge platform
for the research community: Project Free Our Knowledge. We highlight a new
conditional pledge campaign that was initiated at Brainhack 2021 and aims to
motivate a critical mass of neuroscientists to share their research code.
Crucially, this commitment activates only when a user-defined threshold of
support is reached. We conclude by sharing our vision for how the research
community could use collective action campaigns to create a sustained,
evidence-based movement for social change in academia.
