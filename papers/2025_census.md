short_description: 'We investigated the discoverable bacterial and archaeal diversity in a cross-habitat dataset of 92,187 metagenomes, revealing a vast majority of species-level clades hidden among unbinned contigs. We predict that discovery of novel microbial lineages will continue across habitats as more data accrues for the foreseeable future.'

Cataloguing Earth's biodiversity remains one of biology's most formidable challenges, and the greatest diversity is expected to reside among the smallest organisms: microbes. Yet the ongoing census of microbial life is hampered by disparate sampling of Earth's habitats, challenges in isolating uncultivated organisms, limited resolution in taxonomic marker gene amplicons, and incomplete recovery of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Here, we quantified discoverable bacterial and archaeal diversity in a comprehensive, curated cross-habitat dataset of 92,187 metagenomes. Clustering 502M sequences of 130 marker genes, we detected 705k bacterial and 27k archaeal species-level clades, the vast majority of which was hidden among 'unbinned' contigs, beyond current genome-centric approaches. At deeper taxonomic levels, we estimate that 10 archaeal and 145 bacterial novel phyla and around 80k novel genera are discoverable in current data. We identified soils and aquatic environments as novel lineage recovery hotspots, yet predict that discovery will remain in full swing across habitats as more data accrues.
