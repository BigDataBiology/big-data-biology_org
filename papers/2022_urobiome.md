Despite evidence of the resident microbial community in the female lower urinary tract, bacterial species diversity and abundance in healthy women is still unclear. This study demonstrated that complementarity between optimized culture-dependent and –independent approaches is highly beneficial for comprehensive FUM species profiling by detecting higher FUM species diversity than previously reported, including identification of unreported Lactobacillaceae species and putative novel Corynebacterium species. Although some particular species were present in high relative abundance, low-abundant members were more prevalent. FUM classification into community structure types demonstrated high inter-individual differences in urinary microbiome composition among healthy women. We also report moderate correlation between culture-dependent and -independent derived data highlighting drawbacks resulting from each methodological approach. Our findings suggest that FUM bacterial diversity reported from previous studies may be underestimated. Finally, our results contribute to the fundamental knowledge of healthy FUM required for further exploration of the urinary microbiome role in urinary tract diseases.
