Inadequate wastewater treatment can drive the spread of antimicrobial
resistance (AMR), posing risks to ecosystems and human health. Extracellular
DNA (exDNA) plays a key role in AMR persistence by stabilizing antimicrobial
resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment and facilitating horizontal gene
transfer (HGT). However, its taxonomic structure and precise influence on AMR
ecology remain poorly understood, especially in African aquatic systems. We
investigated exDNA-associated resistomes across nine South African wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) and receiving rivers, comparing single-stage activated
sludge process (ASP29 only) and combined ASP-biofilter systems. We found that
exDNA harbours high-risk ARGs, including potentially mobile genes conferring
resistance to last-resort antibiotics. ARGs were enriched in effluents and
downstream rivers, especially where exDNA removal was inefficient.
Surprisingly, ARGs were also abundant upstream of WWTPs, suggesting riverine
reservoirs of exDNA-associated AMR. ARGs were mainly associated with
Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota phyla, suggesting that exDNA is an ecologically
distinct AMR reservoir dominated by a few key taxa. These findings highlight
the need to integrate exDNA into AMR surveillance and highlight its broader
ecological role in shaping microbial evolution and adaptation in freshwater
environments.
