<jats:p>Microbial source tracking quantifies the potential origin of microbial communities, facilitates better understanding of how the taxonomic structure and community functions were formed and maintained. However, previous methods involve a tradeoff between speed and accuracy, and have encountered difficulty in source tracking under many context-dependent settings. Here, we present EXPERT for context-aware microbial source tracking, in which we adopted a Transfer Learning approach to profoundly elevate and expand the applicability of source tracking, enabling biologically informed novel microbial knowledge discovery. We demonstrate that EXPERT can predict microbial sources with performance superior to other methods in efficiency and accuracy. More importantly, we demonstrate EXPERT's context-aware ability on several applications, including tracking the progression of infant gut microbiome development and monitoring the changes of gut microbiome for colorectal cancer patients. Broadly, transfer learning enables accurate and context-aware microbial source tracking and has the potential for novel microbial knowledge discovery.</jats:p>
