Computational algorithms have become an essential component of research, with great efforts by the scientific community to raise standards on development and distribution of code. Despite these efforts, sustainability and reproducibility are major issues since continued validation through software testing is still not a widely adopted practice. Here, we report seven recommendations that help researchers implement software testing in microbial bioinformatics. We have developed these recommendations based on our experience from a collaborative hackathon organised prior to the American Society for Microbiology Next Generation Sequencing (ASM NGS) 2020 conference. We also present a repository hosting examples and guidelines for testing, available from https://github.com/microbinfie-hackathon2020/CSIS.
