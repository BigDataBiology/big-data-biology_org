short_description: 'This study identifies two engineered antimicrobial peptides derived from marine Streptomyces that exert potent activity against uropathogenic E. coli by binding DNA and disrupting transcription and translation, rather than simply damaging the cell membrane. The findings reveal a novel non‑membrane‑lytic mechanism linking peptide‑DNA interaction to antimicrobial effects, highlighting these molecules as promising scaffolds for next‑generation therapeutics against resistant bacterial infections.'
