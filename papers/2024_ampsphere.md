Novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat the antibiotic-resistance
crisis. We present a machine learning-based approach to predict prokaryotic
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) by leveraging a vast dataset of 63,410
metagenomes and 87,920 microbial genomes. This led to the creation of
AMPSphere, a comprehensive catalog comprising 863,498 non-redundant peptides,
the majority of which were previously unknown. We observed that AMP production
varies by habitat, with animal-associated samples displaying the highest
proportion of AMPs compared to other habitats. Furthermore, within different
human-associated microbiota, strain-level differences were evident. To validate
our predictions, we synthesized and experimentally tested 100 AMPs,
demonstrating their efficacy against clinically relevant drug-resistant
pathogens both in vitro and in vivo. These AMPs exhibited antibacterial
activity by targeting the bacterial membrane. Additionally, AMPSphere provides
valuable insights into the evolutionary origins of peptides. In conclusion, our
approach identified AMP sequences within prokaryotic microbiomes, opening up
new avenues for the discovery of antibiotics.
