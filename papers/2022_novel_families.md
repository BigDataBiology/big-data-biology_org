Most microbes on our planet remain uncultured and poorly studied. Recent
efforts to catalog their genetic diversity have revealed that a significant
fraction of the observed microbial genes are functional and evolutionary
untraceable, lacking homologs in reference databases. Despite their potential
biological value, these apparently unrelated orphan genes from uncultivated
taxa have been routinely discarded in metagenomics surveys. Here, we analyzed a
global multi-habitat dataset covering 151,697 medium and high-quality
metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), 5,969 single-amplified genomes (SAGs), and
19,642 reference genomes, and identified 413,335 highly curated novel protein
families under strong purifying selection out of previously considered orphan
genes. These new protein families, representing a three-fold increase over the
total number of prokaryotic orthologous groups described to date, spread out
across the prokaryote phylogeny, can span multiple habitats, and are notably
overrepresented in recently discovered taxa. By genomic context analysis, we
pinpointed thousands of unknown protein families to phylogenetically conserved
operons linked to energy production, xenobiotic metabolism and microbial
resistance. Most remarkably, we found 980 previously neglected protein families
that can accurately distinguish entire uncultivated phyla, classes, and orders,
likely representing synapomorphic traits that fostered their divergence. The
systematic curation and evolutionary analysis of the unique genetic repertoire
of uncultivated taxa opens new avenues for understanding the biology and
ecological roles of poorly explored lineages at a global scale.
