Microbial genes encode the majority of the functional repertoire of life on
earth. However, despite increasing efforts in metagenomic sequencing of various
habitats, little is known about the distribution of genes across the global
biosphere, with implications for human and planetary health. Here we
constructed a non-redundant gene catalogue of 303 million species-level genes
(clustered at 95% nucleotide identity) from 13,174 publicly available
metagenomes across 14 major habitats and use it to show that most genes are
specific to a single habitat. The small fraction of genes found in multiple
habitats is enriched in antibiotic resistance genes and markers for mobile
genetic elements. By further clustering these species-level genes into 32
million protein families, we observed that a small fraction of these families
contain the majority of the genes (0.6% of families account for 50% of the
genes). The majority of species-level genes and protein families are rare.
Furthermore, species-level genes, and in particular the rare ones, show low
rates of positive (adaptive) selection, supporting a model in which most
genetic variability observed within each protein family is neutral or nearly
neutral.
