Genomes are critical units in microbiology, yet ascertaining quality in
prokaryotic genome assemblies remains a formidable challenge. We present GUNC
(the Genome UNClutterer), a tool that accurately detects and quantifies genome
chimerism based on the lineage homogeneity of individual contigs using a
genome’s full complement of genes. GUNC complements existing approaches by
targeting previously underdetected types of contamination: we conservatively
estimate that 5.7% of genomes in GenBank, 5.2% in RefSeq, and 15–30% of
pre-filtered “high-quality” metagenome-assembled genomes in recent studies are
undetected chimeras. GUNC provides a fast and robust tool to substantially
improve prokaryotic genome quality.
