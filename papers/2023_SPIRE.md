SPIRE provides the largest sets of consistently processed metagenomes, newly generated MAGs and profilable microbial species clusters to date. Combined with a high degree of curation and integration of various data modalities (MAGs, contigs, genes, profiles, etc.), SPIRE is the most comprehensive resource available to study microbial diversity and function. Covering a broad range of habitats and geography, SPIRE enables true 'planetary-scale' analyses of microbiomes across various environments, including so far understudied ones. At the same time, SPIRE encompasses large amounts of ‘novel’, previously undescribed microbial diversity both at the gene and genome level.
